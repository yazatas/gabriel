Gabriel C compiler (incidentally gcc) is a compiler written in C++11.

It is an optimizing C compiler but it doesn't conform to the specification (C99) fully because there's
a lot of stuff in there that I don't care about.
Gabriel also features a couple of extensions that I thought C could use such as objects and namespaces.
